  "summary": "REQ-33/REQ-34 appear implemented via base-path-aware static URLs and inline rendering of both photos. REQ-35 is only partially addressed: state resets on `src` change, but there is no retry path for transient failures without a `src` change. The diff also introduces a fullscreen/overlay celebration viewer, which directly violates the stated constraint/non-goal.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-35",
      "requirement": "Provide a graceful retry-friendly rendering path so transient decode/load issues do not permanently lock the component into the fallback state.",
      "reason": "`CelebrationPhoto` sets `hasError` permanently on error and renders only the fallback UI. It resets only when `src` changes (or remount with new `src`), but offers no retry mechanism (e.g., retry button/timer) when `src` is unchanged, so transient errors can still leave the user stuck.",
