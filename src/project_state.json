  "summary": "Build a single-purpose, advanced interactive romantic-themed webpage that asks the user to be the creator's Valentine, with Yes/No options where the No button evades hovering and clicking Yes shows a celebratory state with personalized text, styled with a black-and-pink theme and runnable on iPad/mobile browsers (Chrome/Safari) using only HTML/CSS/JavaScript; replace the celebration GIF with two vertically stacked photos displayed above the celebratory text, shown inline on the page (no fullscreen/lightbox auto-open).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Single-purpose interactive webpage: hover-evading 'No' button and 'Yes' click triggers celebratory GIF + personalized text.",
    "Ensure cross-browser/mobile compatibility (iPad Safari/Chrome): responsive layout, touch-friendly interactions, avoid hover-only behavior and nonstandard APIs.",
    "Evasive “No” button should react with very fast movement to keep it effectively unclickable/unreachable, while still remaining on-screen and touch-safe across iPad/mobile.",
    "Button labels on the initial prompt include emojis alongside text (YES: 👅, NO: 😔).",
    "Evasive NO motion should remain the same speed but use smooth transitions for movement/hover feedback.",
    "Apply consistent romantic typography across the full experience (initial + celebration states).",
    "Update celebratory state message copy to use the names \"Zainab\" and \"Hamza\" (per latest request: \"zainab hamza\").",
    "Update the last line of the celebratory message copy to exactly: \"Your Hamza loves you soo muchieee\".",
    "Add an additional final line after \"Your Hamza loves you soo muchieee\": \"PLEASE BE MY WIFE AND THE MOTHER OF MY KIDS I LOVE YOU INFINTE TIMES\".",
    "Add more romantic celebratory lines that clearly express lifelong love and a shared future together (post-YES state), keeping the overall romantic/playful tone."

  "known_issues": [
    "Requirements changed: photos must be visible inline on the page (no fullscreen/lightbox auto-open) while keeping celebration text below; ensure current implementation matches this and both photos reliably render.",
    "Reported issue: photos are not displaying/appearing as expected on YES (user asked to 'forcefully open them'); need to ensure they render automatically inline above the text with no fullscreen behavior.",
    "Celebration state shows error: \"photo could not be loaded\"; fix required so both inline photos reliably load/render above the text."
